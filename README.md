# Public installation and usage documentation for BAUTA's Blindsensorkit

## Setting up the hardware

The Blindsensorkit comes with three components. The first one is the optical part with the lens
encased in a waterproof case, the second one is BAUTA's security module also encased, and the 
third is an extension adapter to allow to flexible extend the ribbon cable that usually is 
connected directly between the optical part and BAUTA's security module. This extension adapter
also is enclosed in a simple removable case to protect it from potential electrostatic discharges
during operation and installation.

After mounting both the optical and security module and before connecting the power-supply to 
the security module make sure you connect the two ribbon cables from each first to the 
extension adapter. For doing this you first have to open up the enclosure of the adapter which 
should look like the following:

After the enclosure has been opened you have to take the adapter out of the enclosure to be able
to connect the two ribbon cables on each end

Please ensure you place the adapter with the correct side up just as shown in the picture above
and also the ribbon cables are facing the same way up as in the picture with the silver connector
being clearly visible. Connecting the cables the wrong way can lead potentially to a short circuit and
render the device unusuable, so please be careful!

After you have connected the two ribbon cables to the adapter you can place it back inside its
enclosure as show below

and close the lid on top again
